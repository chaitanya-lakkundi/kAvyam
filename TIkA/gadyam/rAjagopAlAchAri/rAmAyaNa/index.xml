      <description>To the north of the Ganga was the great kingdom Kosala, made fertile by the river Sarayu. Its capital was Ayodhya, built by Manu, the famous ruler of the Solar dynasty. From Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s description of the capital Kosala, it is clear that ancient Ayodhya was not inferior to our modern cities. Even in ancient India city civilisation had reached a high level. King Dasaratha ruled the kingdom from the capital city of Ayodhya.</description>

      <description>In course of time, Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s sons were born Rama of Kausalya and Bharata of Kaikeyi. Sumitra gave birth to twins, Lakshmana and Satrughna. She had drunk the divine payasam twice. In proportion to the quantity of payasam drunk by the respective mothers, the sons are traditionally considered to be parts of Vishnu. Rama was thus half- Vishnu. But such calculations have no meaning, as it is impossible to measure the Infinite arithmetically.</description>

      <description>That was the time when the famous king of the Solar dynasty, Trisanku, was reigning, who was so much in love with the beauty of his body that he could not bear the thought of parting with it at death and desired to ascend to heaven in that very body. Vasishtha, his preceptor, whom he approached for help in realising his wish, advised him to give up attempting the impossible. Dissatisfied with Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s response, the King approached the sage&amp;rsquo;s sons and sought their help.</description>

      <description>King, Dasaratha received Viswamitra as Indra would welcome Brahma and touching his feet, the King said: &amp;ldquo;I am indeed blessed among men. Your coming can only be due to the merit of my ancestors. Like the morning sun that dispels the darkness of night, your face brings joy to my sight. My heart is full. Born a king, you have become through tapas a Brahma Rishi. And you yourself have come seeking my dwelling.</description>

      <description>Viswamitra and the two princes spent the night on the bank of the river Sarayu. Before retiring Viswamitra initiated the princes in two secret mantras Bala and Atibala, which had the virtue of guarding them from fatigue and harm. They slept on the verdant bank that night and rising at dawn proceeded on their journey. They reached Kamashrama in Anga Desa. After presenting the princes to the rishis there, Viswamitra recounted to them the history of the ashrama.</description>

      <description>Janaka, king of Mithila, was an ideal ruler. He was a much revered friend of Dasaratha who, when he planned his yaga for progeny, sent not mere messengers but ministers to Mithila to invite King Janaka. Janaka was not only a brave king but was as well-versed in the Sastras and Vedas as any rishi and was the beloved pupil of Yajnavalkya whose exposition of Brahmana to him is the substance of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.</description>

      <description>KING Sagara waited in vain for the return of the princes who had gone in search of the sacrificial horse. After some days he called his grandson, Amsuman, and said: &amp;ldquo;I am anxious to know what has happened to the princes who went to Patala. You are brave; go thither, well-armed and find out what has happened and come back crowned with success.&amp;rdquo; Amsuman went closely following the path of the princes and reached the nether world where he saw and paid salutations to the mighty elephants standing guard at the four quarters.</description>

      <description>After a day&amp;rsquo;s stay in the City of Visala, Viswamitra and his party left for Mithila. On the way, not far from Mithila, they saw a beautiful ashrama which seemed untenanted. Rama asked Viswamitra: &amp;ldquo;Whose is this ashrama with ancient trees? Why does such a beautiful abode stand deserted?&amp;rdquo; Viswamitra replied: &amp;ldquo;This ashrama is subject to a curse. Sage Gautama lived here with his wife Ahalya, spending his days in peace and holy meditation.</description>

      <description>All arrangements for Janaka&amp;rsquo;s yaga had been completed and to Mithila had come many rishis and Brahman&amp;rsquo;s from various kingdoms. Viswamitra and the princeswere duly welcomed. Janaka&amp;rsquo;s preceptor, Satananda, was the first to pay honor to Viswamitra. Janaka followed him. The King said to the sage: &amp;ldquo;I am indeed blessed that you should attend my yaga.&amp;rdquo; Pointing to Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka asked Viswamitra: &amp;ldquo;Who are these god-like youths who resemble each other, and carry their weapons with the proud ease of seasoned warriors?</description>

      <description>Having thus safely handed back to Dasaratha at Mithila the princes entrusted to him in Ayodhya, and after attending the wedding celebrations, Viswamitra took leave of the two kings and went to Himalaya. In the story of Rama, Viswamitra has no further part. Viswamitra may be said to be the foundation of the grand temple of Rama&amp;rsquo;s story. After Rama&amp;rsquo;s wedding in Mithila, we do not see him again. It should be noted that characters that play a leading role in one canto of Valmiki almost fade out in subsequent cantos.</description>

      <description>RAMA and Sita spent twelve happy years in Ayodhya. But now the Lord and his consort in human form had to experience the hardships, sorrows and conflicts of life on earth. As Bhagavan himself explains: &amp;ldquo;Whatever avatar I assume, my play must go through the feelings and experiences appropriate to that incarnation.&amp;rdquo; Who was the Prince of Ayodhya who through his body, life and experience, suffered the sorrows of mankind and saved the gods?</description>

      <description>THE King embraced Rama, seated him beside him on the throne and said: &amp;ldquo;I am old. I have enjoyed my life as a man and a king. I have discharged all my duties to my ancestors. There is nothing left for me to do. My only desire is to install you on the throne of our fathers. Last night I had bad dreams. Those who read, the future advise me that a great sorrow, even death, may overtake me very soon.</description>

      <description>Kaikeyi, who had looked upon Rama as her own son, was enmeshed in Manthara&amp;rsquo;s arguments and became helpless. &amp;ldquo;Indeed, I am afraid,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Tell me what we should do. Am I to be a servant to Kausalya? Never, Bharata must be crowned. You are quite right. And Rama must be sent to forest. But how shall we get all this done? Tell me. You are clever and know the way.</description>

      <description>Dasaratha was thunder-struck. When his mind resumed its function, he doubted the reality of what had happened. &amp;ldquo;Could it be other than a hideous dream? Or the phantasmagoria of a disordered brain? Or the sudden materialisation of the sins of some past birth called up for my chastisement? I am certainly the victim of an illusion. I cannot believe this to be reality.&amp;rdquo; Unable to stand the confused agony of shapeless terrors, he closed his eyes and became unconscious.</description>

      <description>POOR Dasaratha was in extreme agony, pulled by natural affection on one side and by the moral obligation to fulfil a pledge on the other. He had fondly hoped that Kaikeyi would relent and that somehow the conflict of duties would be resolved. But now he saw that this was not to be. He had still one faint hope: &amp;ldquo;Rama is in no way bound by my promises and pledges. Strong as he is in people&amp;rsquo;s love and in his peerless prowess, he may disregard my promise, and stand on his own rights.</description>

      <description>RAMA went to Queen Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s dwelling. Many visitors were assembled there, eagerly awaiting the coronation. In the innermost apartment, the Queen, clad in white silk, was before the sacrificial fire invoking blessings on her son. As soon as Rama entered, she embraced him and showed him, who she thought, was to become the Yuvaraja, to a specially raised seat. &amp;ldquo;Mother, this seat is now too high for me,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. &amp;ldquo;I am a hermit and should sit on grass spread on the floor.</description>

      <description>What took place in the inner apartments of the palace was not yet known to the town-people. But Rama for his part lost no time in preparing for forest life. He went to Queen Kausalya to receive her blessings before leaving the city. Kausalya said to him again: &amp;ldquo;How can I stay in Ayodhya after you are gone? It is best that I go with you to the forest.&amp;rdquo; Of course, she knew that her duty was to serve her husband in his old age and share his sorrow in Ayodhya.</description>

      <description>AFTER Rama left his father&amp;rsquo;s presence with these words, the stricken King lay prostrated in speechless sorrow, and it was some time before he could muster his faculties sufficiently even to think. When he recovered some strength, he muttered half unconsciously: &amp;ldquo;Surely I must in a previous birth have inflicted hideous suffering to loving hearts. I must have torn calves from their mothers, children from their parents, husbands from their wives.</description>

      <description>The citizens who had slept on the bank of the Tamasa woke up in the morning and looked round. They were surprised to see that Rama and the chariot had disappeared. They followed the track of the chariot-wheels but were disappointed to find that it was lost in the main road to the capital. They returned home to their own houses and sought satisfaction in reviling Kaikeyi. Without Rama, the city was bereft of beauty and wrapt in gloom.</description>

      <description>Rama spent the night in Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama. Getting up in the morning, they paid their respects to the Maharishi and, taking leave of him, set out for the Chitrakuta hill. The muni treated them affectionately as if they were his own children and sent them forth with his blessings after explaining to them the way they should take through the forest. The three followed his topographical instructions closely and in due course came upon the river Kalindi.</description>

      <description>Sumantra and Guha stood watching the three figures as long as they could. When they disappeared from sight, they were plunged in sorrow and went back to Guha&amp;rsquo;s town. After a while Sumantra returned to Ayodhya. As the charioteer approached the city, he found it desolate and devoid of the usual cheerful bustle of urban life. Assoon as he crossed the fortress-gate and entered the city, his chariot was surrounded by a crowd eagerly asking: &amp;ldquo;Where did you leave Rama?</description>

      <description>Dasaradha had been driven ruthlessly by circumstances to an action which not only broke his heart but made him hate himself and deprived him even of self- pity. The only way out of the dilemma of either breaking his plighted word or doing a great wrong to Rama would have been for the latter to disobey him and insist on his rights. But Rama placed his duty to his father high above all other things.</description>

      <description>Dasaratha continued: &amp;ldquo;Listen, I shall tell you what followed. Having committed a sin and seeing the young ascetic die, I stood wondering what-to do next. Finally I decided that it was my duty and my interest to do what he advised me. I cleaned the pitcher, and filling it with fresh water, took it and went along the footpath he had pointed out. I reached his cottage and there I saw the old couple waiting for the return of their son.</description>

      <description>Kausalya clung to the King&amp;rsquo;s body and cried: &amp;ldquo;I shall go with the King to Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode. How can I live without my son and without my husband?&amp;rdquo; The elders and officers of the palace managed to separate her from the dead King and take her away. Then they discussed about the funeral rites. They could not be performed immediately, for Rama and Lakshmana had gone to the forest and Bharata and Satrughna were far away in their uncle&amp;rsquo;s place.</description>

      <description>Now Bharata understood everything and realised the enormity of the harm wrought by his mother. Overwhelmed by grief and near, he could not control himself. At the thought of what she had done and the eternal infamy she had incurred, his grief grew wild and he hurled cruel words at her. &amp;ldquo;What have you done?&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;Did you ever hope to make me accept the kingdom? Deprived of such a father and such a brother, am I likely to care for power?</description>

      <description>GAZING across the river Ganga, Guha, the hunter-king, noticed unusual commotion on the bank opposite. A great army had encamped there. He pointed it to his kinsmen standing by his side and said: &amp;ldquo;Who is this and why has he come here with a large army, apparently to cross the river? The flag suggests that it is Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s son Bharata and his army. Yes, I see the flag flying on the top of the chariot and I can recognise the tree painted on it.</description>

      <description>WHILE Bharata was thus engaged in trying to undo the mischief wrought by others, in the forest hut at Chitrakuta, life went on fairly cheerfully. With Lakshmana and Sita by his side, Rama lacked nothing. The grandeur of the mountain scenery and the forest and the sweet songs and play of the birds pleased his heart. He forgot the sorrow of his exile from kinsfolk and city. &amp;ldquo;Look, Sita, at those birds playing,&amp;rdquo; he would say.</description>

      <description>WHEN it was known that the four princes and the three queens were reunited and could be seen together in one place, a chorus of joy went up in the army and retinue and they came surging forward to witness that happy spectacle. They were sure now that Rama would return to Ayodhya and the people embraced one another for the very joy. The sage Vasishtha conducted the three queens to the hut.</description>

      <description>NOT far from Chitrakuta was an outpost of the Rakshasas, called Janasthana, in charge of a famous warrior named Khara, who was a brother of Ravana. From this station, fierce Rakshasas ranged the forest round, molesting the rishis in their isolated ashramas. They made life so insecure that the rishis abandoned their hermitages in the Chitrakuta region in spite of all that Rama could do to dissuade them. After Bharata&amp;rsquo;s departure Rama was not quite happy in Chitrakuta.</description>

      <description>Now begins the Aranya Kanda. The poet begins with an episode that prepares us for the misfortunes of Sita. A new responsibility has been cast on the prince. He is to destroy rakshasas who molest the rishis in the Dandaka forest. A fear arose in Sita&amp;rsquo;s heart like a shadow cast by events to come. &amp;ldquo;Why should you and Lakshmana who are properly to be merely ascetics in the forest&amp;rdquo; asked Sita of her beloved husband, &amp;ldquo;take on yourselves this task of protection?</description>

      <description>THE Princes and Sita, following Agastya&amp;rsquo;s instruction, took the way to Panchavati. On the way they met a huge figure perched on a big tree. They took it to be a Rakshasa. &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; asked Rama in an angry tone. The vulture however answered in a voice full of mildness and affection: &amp;ldquo;My child, I am your father&amp;rsquo;s aged friend.&amp;rdquo; Then he proceeded to tell his story. Jatayu was the brother of Sampati, the son of Aruna the dawn-god, who was brother to Garuda the great eagle-vehicle of Vishnu.</description>

      <description>RAMA and Lakshmana drove out Surpanakha, as one takes a stick and drives out a donkey straying into a garden. Such is the brief and simple treatment of this incident by Valmiki. Kamban, the Tamil poet, however, deals with it more elaborately and has made a number of changes in the story. Sitting on the riverbank, Rama watched a swan walking and then looked at Sita, also walking. Noting the similarity in the gait, Rama was pleased and smiled.</description>

      <description>ACCOMPANIED by the fourteen generals of Khara, Surpanakha came back to Rama&amp;rsquo;s ashrama, determined to avenge herself and drink the blood of the princes. Pointing to the two young men, she told her escort, &amp;ldquo;Look, there stand the men who insulted and mutilated me. Slay them immediately.&amp;rdquo; Rama understood the situation at once and told Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;Take care of Sita for a while, while I deal with those fellows.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, he took up his bow.</description>

      <description>AKAMPANA, one of the few Rakshasas who survived the great slaughter at Panchavati, fled to Lanka and seeking audience of Ravana, said: &amp;ldquo;Almost all our people who occupied Janasthana are dead and Janasthana is now an empty ruin. I alone have managed to escape with life.&amp;rdquo; Ravana was furious with anger. He stared and violently shouted: &amp;ldquo;Who destroyed my lovely Janasthana? Was it Yama or Agni or Vishnu? I shall deal death to the god of death.</description>

      <description>MARICHA told Ravana, &amp;ldquo;I have listened, my king, to all that you have said and I am filled with boundless sorrow. It is easy to flatter. Flattery is ever pleasant to the ears. Those who utter good though unpalatable advice are few; and fewer still are those who welcome it when given. Yet it is my duty to speak to you the harsh truth. Sweet words might please you now, but will surely lead you to danger and ruin.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;ALAS, alas! Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo; So cried Maricha simulating Rama&amp;rsquo;s voice. And Sita was deceived. Trembling like a plantain tree in a storm, she cried: &amp;ldquo;There, Lakshmana, do you not hear your brother&amp;rsquo;s voice? Run, run at once to his help!&amp;rdquo; Overwhelmed by fear and seeing Lakshmana unwilling to move, she appealed to Lakshmana again and again in an agony of anxiety: &amp;ldquo;I hear my Lord&amp;rsquo;s voice in distress. Go, go at once!</description>

      <description>SITA opened her eyes red with anger and grief, and facing Ravana cried: &amp;ldquo;Base fellow! You boasted of your fame andyour great origin and your warlike qualities, but have you behaved like a brave warrior? Are you not ashamed of yourself? What sort of warrior is he who waits for the husband&amp;rsquo;s absence to steal his wife and carries off a lonely helpless woman when no one is nearer to prevent it?</description>

      <description>WHEN Maricha was struck by Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrow and was about to die, he resumed his own Rakshasa shape and cried aloud in a voice which was an exact imitation of Rama&amp;rsquo;s: &amp;ldquo;Ah Lakshmana. Ah Sita!&amp;rdquo; Rama now realised how the Rakshasa had beguiled them and how be had been drawn away a long distance by the crafty Maricha and he was full of anxiety as to what it all could mean.</description>

      <description>THE two brothers searched every mountain, forest and riverbank calling Sita&amp;rsquo;s name aloud. But all in vain, and they did not so much as find a clue anywhere. Baffled and grief-stricken, Rama cried out against the river Godavari, against the gods and against the five elements. The poet sage ascribes the silence of the rivers and the gods and elements to their fear of the powerful Rakshasa king. A herd of deer, however, moving southwards seemed to indicate to Rama and Lakshmana that they too should travel in the same direction.</description>

      <description>IN face of the unexpected difficulties that overtook them one after another, Rama and Lakshmana often lost heart. Their fortitude yielded place sometimes to great despair. But they managed to encourage each other and proceeded on their way. Passing through the forest, the two princes were suddenly caught by a tremendously big Rakshasa of ugly form without head or feet. His mouth was in his great belly and he had two enormous arms which, without moving from his place, he would stretch out and clutch tiger, bear or any other living thing within reach, and swallow them.</description>

      <description>THEN Sugriva heard the story of the calamity that had befallen the Raghu princes at Panchavati and how Rama&amp;rsquo;s heart was breaking with the ache of separation from Sita and anxiety as to her fate. Deeply touched, Sugriva tried to console Rama. &amp;ldquo;I have heard everything from Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Lay aside all doubts and fears. We shall surely discover Sita, wherever she may be concealed, and that, soon. My companions and myself noticed a Rakshasa carrying a weeping lady and speeding fast across the sky.</description>

      <description>SUGRIVA was keen on regaining his kingdom and family, but he could not see how this was to be. Vali&amp;rsquo;s strength stood as an impossible barrier between him and the fulfilment of his desire. Hanuman, his minister, tried to convince him that is would succeed with Rama&amp;rsquo;s help, but Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s doubts persisted. Could Rama&amp;rsquo;s strength overcome Vali&amp;rsquo;s? It all looked hopelessly impossible. Vali&amp;rsquo;s body was like steel. How was Rama going to kill him?</description>

      <description>EVENING was approaching. Once more Sugriva roared at the gate of Kishkindha and challenged Vali to fight. Vali who was then resting happily was startled and for a moment paled with puzzled concern, but was presently overwhelmed with rage and sprung stamping the earth as though he would split it. Tara, his queen, her heart full of loving fear, held him in arms in a close embrace and tried to restrain his impetuosity with affectionate counsel.</description>

      <description>THERE was panic in Kishkindha when the news came that Vali had been slain by an archer, and the Vanaras fled hither and thither in hopeless confusion. Tara, seeing this, laid aside her own grief and like a queen put courage in her husband&amp;rsquo;s subjects saying: &amp;ldquo;Till this day you walked before the King to battle! Why, then do you flee in fear now? There is no danger for you. Rama killed Vali only to make Sugriva king.</description>

      <description>THE rainy season began. Sugriva and his companions spent the time in Kishkindha in enjoyment but Rama and Lakshmana spent the weary days waiting in a cave nearby. The forest paths were flooded and became rushing torrents, impossible to traverse. The search for Sita, therefore, had to be suspended. Rama brooded over Sita&amp;rsquo;s predicament and was plunged in sorrow. Lakshmana counselled him to bear with the delay till the rainy season ended.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;LOOK, Rama, at this Vanara army,&amp;rdquo; said Sugriva. &amp;ldquo;All these myriads, of wondrous strength, are yours to command. They are willing and able to do you all the service you demand. Consider this huge army as your own and bid them to do whatever you wish.&amp;rdquo; Rama, beside himself with joy; embraced Sugriva. He said: &amp;ldquo;First we should find out whether Sita is alive, and if so where she is. Next we should know Ravana&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts.</description>

      <description>FROM Sampati the Vanaras learnt the place where Sita was kept a prisoner in the land of the Rakshasa, a hundred yojanas across the ocean. But of course it would not do to return to Sugriva at once with this second-hand information. They had outstayed the allotted time and only outstanding success could save them from punishment. They could not stop their search till they saw with their own eyes what Sampati had described only then could they fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose.</description>

      <description>FULL of hope, Hanuman alighted and set foot in Lanka. But soon the flush of triumph at the accomplishment of the journey gave place to sober thinking. &amp;ldquo;True I have crossed the sea, but that is only the beginning of my mission. There, on mount Trikuta, stands Ravana&amp;rsquo;s magnificent city, as if suspended in the sky. How beautiful, how wealthy, how well secured it is! The city and the fortress are not inferior to Amaravati or Bhagavati.</description>

      <description>As HANUMAN stood on the high wall, he did not know why, a thrill of joy passed through his frame. It was the invisible atmosphere which envelopes an accomplished mission and influences subtly the devoted heart. As be had at last reached the spot where Sita was, his whole being throbbed with exulting expectation without any apparent reason. It was an early spring night. Trees and plants were in flowers. Hanuman jumped to a place where there was a thick cluster of trees.</description>

      <description>TO SITA, plunged in a sea of sorrow and clinging to dharma and to the thought of her lord, Ravana spoke these words: &amp;ldquo;O beautiful one! Why do you shrink from me? Do you not see how much I care for you? Though it is lawful for a Rakshasa to take another&amp;rsquo;s wife and possess her by force, I am a beggar for your love. There is no need to fear me.</description>

      <description>THE boldest and most strong-minded woman may, if kept in captivity for a long period, lose heart and become depressed. Sita hoped month after month that her lord would discover her whereabouts and come to her rescue. Sick with disappointed hope, alone in the midst of enemies, she clung to life only from an abiding faith in the love of Rama that made her feel that he would surely come. The Rakshasis plied her with what from their point of view was well-meant counsel.</description>

      <description>HIDDEN by the branches, Hanuman sang in a sweet and gentle voice the story of Rama so that it fell on Sita&amp;rsquo;s ears: &amp;ldquo;King Dasaratha ruled his kingdom well. His army was mighty and comprisedof chariots, elephants and horses. He was virtuous and a doer of great deeds. He kept his word and was foremost among the famous kings of the world. He was equal to the rishis in virtue and to Indra in statesmanship.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DEAR, dear Vanara friend,&amp;rdquo; said Sita, &amp;ldquo;I do not know whether to rejoice or grieve at the news you have brought. Your words are like nectar mixed with poison. My lord&amp;rsquo;s love for me is sweetest nectar, and his grief over my plight is bitterest poison.&amp;rdquo; Thus Sita spoke what she felt and found comfort in putting in words her love and her grief. Pleasure and pain, happiness and misery alternately impel human beings.</description>

      <description>AFTER taking leave of Sita, Hanuman sat for a while on the top of the garden wall and began to think: &amp;ldquo;What can I do to put courage into Sita and some fear into Ravana and his friends to shake their arrogant confidence? It would be good to leave them some souvenir of my visit, some indication of what the future has in store for them. It is clear I must instill some fear into Ravana to prevent him from troubling Sita in the meantime.</description>

      <description>THE Rakshasa warriors saw with amazement a mighty Vanara seated on the garden gate, who at their approach grew to still bigger size and formidable menace. &amp;ldquo;Oh! You have come, have you?&amp;rdquo; he said and, jumping down, brandished his tail, and striking the ground with it, roared till the four quarters shook. He snatched the huge iron bar from the gate and, armed with this weapon, began to attack them all.</description>

      <description>VALMIKI describes in beautiful verses how the youthful warrior Aksha, the equal of the gods, rode to battle in a chariot drawn by eight horses. Who can put up in a different tongue Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s poetry describing the beauty of forests and the terrible fury of encounters between warriors? The rhythm and grandeur of his words convey the terror and majesty of what he describes. This power is Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s special gift. We can only summarise in pedestrian prose his glowing account, of the battle between Aksha, the beloved son of Ravana, and Hanuman.</description>

      <description>His captors took him to the court of Ravana and placed him in front of the King. Forgetting the pain and insults he had borne, Hanuman gazed with wrathful curiosity at the giant monarch. As he gazed at him resplendent on his throne a sort of pitying admiration of the doomed Rakshasa entered his thoughts. Clad in silk of golden hue, with the royal crown on his head, the jewels inlaid in it shining brilliantly, Ravana sat there, a figure of dazzling splendor.</description>

      <description>BESIDE themselves with joy at the sight of Hanuman, the Vanaras assembled on the Mahendra peak. And the veteran Jambavan welcoming the son of Vayu with great affection, spoke on behalf of all. &amp;ldquo;We are eager to hear a full account of your journey and its triumphant conclusion. More particularly, we are anxious to know how you discovered Sita. How is she now? What is the state of her mind and body?</description>

      <description>SUGRIVA&amp;rsquo;S conjecture was like nectar to Rama&amp;rsquo;s ears. They eagerly awaited the arrival of the Vanaras. In a short while a great clamor was in the air and the Vanara hordes alighted with cries of triumph. Hanuman and Angada leading, the Vanaras marched to the presence of their king who with Rama and Lakshmana was awaiting their coming. Hanuman bowed and said: &amp;ldquo;Seen have I the Goddess of purity, your queen.</description>

      <description>RAMA heard Hanuman with heart and eyes overflowing and, when he had come to the end of his narrative, said: &amp;ldquo;The deed done by Hanuman none else in the world could even conceive of attempting, crossing the sea, entering Lanka protected by Ravana and his formidable hosts and accomplishing the task set him by his king not only fully but beyond the fondest hopes of all.&amp;rdquo; And it saddened him to think that it was not in his power to reward Hanuman at all adequately for the supreme joy he had brought.</description>

      <description>Now let us leave Rama and his host here and go back to Ravana. Great poets in all languages delineate with sympathy even their bad characters allowing gleams of goodness to shine through occasionally, for nature has not made anybody wholly and unredeemably evil. The poet&amp;rsquo;s aim is to direct the reader&amp;rsquo;s mind into the path of good, the satvik way. For this purpose they use all their skill and power in developing even their rajasik and tamasik characters.</description>

      <description>AS soon as the day dawned, Vibhishana went to the king. He had thought deeply over the matter and had come to a decision. His brother&amp;rsquo;s welfare demanded that he should seek somehow to convert and save him. Vibhishana entered the royal palace and stood with folded hands before the king. Ravana sent away all but the principal Ministers and asked his brother to speak. &amp;ldquo;My brother and my lord,&amp;rdquo; began Vibhishana, &amp;ldquo;forgive me if what I say is not pleasing to your ears.</description>

      <description>KUMBHAKARNA, the younger brother of Ravana, spoke in the assembly: &amp;ldquo;Great King! Ignoring the principles of statecraft, you have run into a great danger. If you had any grievance against Rama and Lakshmana, you should have met them face to face and defeated and slain them before carrying off Sita. If you had acted thus, even Sita would have admired you and there would then have been a possibility of her accepting you.</description>

      <description>HAVING committed a sin and run into danger, Ravana did not see how to extricate himself. Like other kings in a quandary, he called a council for consultation. Many spoke flattering words. Only two spoke harshly. One said: &amp;ldquo;You have committed a fault. But I will give up my life for you.&amp;rdquo; This was Kumbhakarna. The other, Vibhishana, said: &amp;ldquo;You have committed a sin, but there is still time for repentance and escape from consequences.</description>

      <description>IN response to Rama&amp;rsquo;s invitation, Hanuman expressed his opinion in clear, sweet and pregnant words: &amp;ldquo;Why should you ask for our advice? Not even Brihaspati has anything to tell you that you do not already know. If it is dangerous to admit Vibhishana, how is the danger met by delay and trial? Where is the time or opportunity for a test? More over, Vibhishana has not approached us stealthily. He has come to us with frank openness and a clear object.</description>

      <description>MEANWHILE Ravana did something foolish. He sent a scout to seduce Sugriva from his loyalty to Rama. This Rakshasa, Suka by name, flew across and in disguise met Sugriva in secret and with every appearance of benevolent solicitude spoke to him thus: &amp;ldquo;Ravana, the king of Lanka, has sent me because of his affection and regard for you. He sends you his fraternal greetings. You are a king and he is another and there is no sense in your staking your high heritage and making common cause with a disinherited prince against an all- powerful king.</description>

As the army burst in like a flood the frightened beasts and birds in the forest fled in all directions. Valmiki describes the scene and the event in his characteristic style. Gazing now from below at the mountain fortress and the divinely beautiful city constructed by Viswakarma, Rama was again filled with wonder and exclaimed: &amp;ldquo;Oh what beauty!</description>

They were rough with me and made me feel thankful to be allowed to come back. Rama, to whom it was sport to slay Viradha, Kabandha, Khara and others, has arrived with the army of Sugriva.

      <description>RAVANA as duly informed that Rama&amp;rsquo;s Vanara host surrounded Lanka like a tumultuous sea. In an angry mood he went up the tower of his mansion and surveyed the scene. On every side he saw Vanara warriors who had armed themselves with trees and boulders. He wondered how he could destroy this vast invading force. At the same time, Rama saw the City of Lanka guarded by the Rakshasas. He could see with his mind&amp;rsquo;s eye the sad figure of Sita held captive within those walls.</description>

      <description>RAVANA from within his palace was surprised to hear, borne on the wind, the jubilant acclamations of the Vanaras, who he thought must then be mourning their vanquished leaders and slaughtered comrades. He turned to the Rakshasas standing beside him and asked: &amp;ldquo;What has happened to make the Vanaras so happy? Something strange must have occurred. Go and find out what it is.&amp;rdquo; Some Rakshasas climbed up and looked over the wall.</description>

      <description>WHEN Ravana returned humbled and dejected, the gods rejoiced foreseeing the speedy end of their troubles. Ravana entered the fortress, ashamed and anxious. After deliberating a while, he recovered his courage and ordered his sleeping brother Kumbhakarna to be roused. As the result of a curse, Kumbhakarna used to sleep for months together and he had gone to sleep just a few days before the events last narrated. Ravana asked his ministers to spare no efforts to rouse Kumbhakarna at once and get him ready for battle.</description>

      <description>RALLIED by Angada, the Vanaras recovered courage, reformed in battle order and prepared to receive Kumbhakarna. They hurled rocks at him and dealt heavy blows with trees plucked by the roots. But he disregarded them all and with a smile on his face went on dispatching the Vanaras with a methodic cruelty that was most terrifying. Some of them retreated to the newly built dam, while others tried to save themselves by concealing on the shore of the sea and the forests.</description>

      <description>INDRAJIT comforted his father. &amp;ldquo;Why should you worry when I am here alive?&amp;rdquo; he said and gathered an army, and with it made another sortie. He swooped down on the Vanara forces and killed and wounded thousands of them. They were helpless against his fury. The Brahmastra of Indrajit was effective against even Rama and Lakshmana who were tied up by it. They lay unconscious on the ground and the Rakshasa prince went straight to his anxious father with the glad news of this achievement.</description>

      <description>THERE was wailing in every house in Lanka. In Ravana&amp;rsquo;s breast grief, shame and anger seethed like a raging sea. He had so far sent his commanders and men in detachments, and, brave as they were, they had been destroyed in detail. This had been the result of overweening confidence in his invincibility and contempt for the enemy, most of whom fought with no better weapons than sticks and stones. But repeated reverses had brought him no wisdom.</description>

      <description>VIBHISHANA was crowned King of Lanka in a magnificent ceremony. The new Lord of Lanka came out to the Vanara camp and bowed low before Rama. Then Rama said to Hanuman: &amp;ldquo;With the King&amp;rsquo;s permission, enter Lanka and tell Sita what has happened.&amp;rdquo; Hanuman accordingly took permission from Vibhishana and went to Asoka Vana to convey the news to Sita. Sita&amp;rsquo;s joy was beyond words. She was silent. &amp;ldquo;Why, mother,&amp;rdquo; asked Hanuman, &amp;ldquo;why do you not speak?</description>

      <description>On one occasion Gandhiji and I were talking about a girl very dear to both of us. I said: &amp;ldquo;How did she get all these ideas and phrases of love without having read any of present-day love stories?&amp;rdquo; Gandhiji said in answer: &amp;ldquo;But has she not read the Ramayana? Is the Ramayana not a love story too?&amp;rdquo; This struck me as profound. Then we turned to other matters. Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s troubles began with love.</description>
